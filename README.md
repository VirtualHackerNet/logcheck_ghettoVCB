# logcheck_ghettoVCB
Logchecker for ghettoVCB

Please edit the script (logchecker.sh) to suit the ghettoVCB configuration that is currently used.
it is meant to clean up after itself and give a log of backups executed and show the time it took to run them.

Prior to using this script the VMware ESX host needs to use ghettoVCB for backups. (https://github.com/lamw/ghettoVCB)
